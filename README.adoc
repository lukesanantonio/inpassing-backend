= Data model

_See inpassing/models.py for all the details._

== Org
Orgs have parking spaces and give out passes to users. Each org has a set of
states and some amount of parking spaces.

== User
Users can moderate an org or participate in an org.

== Pass
Passes are defined by a state and a spot number. The state could be 'A', 'B' for
A-B parking or 'M', 'T', 'W', etc for schedules that work on a weekly basis.
Passes don't exist until they are claimed by a user and verified by an org.
Passes are requested through the requestlog table, which stores the user who is
making the request, along with the *requested* state and spot. The Org may
decide to assign the user to a different spot, however.

== DayState
Right now it's basically a string that users of the service will recognize, IE
'A' or 'B' or 'Monday' or 'Tuesday', etc. It is referenced by its unique ID.
